# 2021-01-30 Personal aggregators

Many Gemini users are using CAPCOM as the "start page". But some of active Gemini visitors aren't satisfied. Usually, their thoughts go in one of two directions:

- An own instance of CAPCOM
- Some kind of client-side aggregation

=> gemini://makeworld.gq/gemlog/2020-08-02-personal-feeds.gmi "Personal Feeds (response to Solderpunk)"

For now I have two different clients on my phone and on my desktop. And there is no way to sync my subscriptions between them. My own dedicated "Gemini App" (server) could be a solution. But I don't want to edit any text files to update the subscriptions. Maybe I need a good-old Web App as the "admin interface"? Looks doable but not fun.

Need to think aboutâ€¦
